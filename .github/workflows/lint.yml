      # First of all, Lefthook is name of a task runner.
      #
      # This job run all commands of `lint` task.
      # The files to lint is the all files, which are manged by Git.
      # Not the all modified files on push.
      #
      # NOTE
      # On Lefthook v1.5.5,
      # You cannot change the files to lint passed to `lint` task of Lefthook
      # with using `--file strings` option of Lefthook CLI
      # because the commands of `lint` task use `{all_files}` files template.
      #
      # `--file strings` option of Lefthook v1.5.5:
      # - `{all_files}`
      #   The option does not overwrite `{all_files}` file template.
      #   The commands of `lint` task use `{all_files}` file template.
      # - `{stagin_files}`
      #   The option overwrites `{stagin_files}` files template.

      # Does not separate the commands of `lint` task
      # by step or job of GitHub Actions,
      # as in the following codes:
      # - Separates commands by step
      #   Example
      #   ``` YAML
      #   # Runs one task for each step.
      #   - name: Lint
      #     uses: ./.github/actions/run_task_runner
      #     with:
      #       task_name: lint
      #     - name
      #     ```
      # - Separates commands by job
      #   Example
      #   ``` YAML
      #   # Runs one task for each job.
      #   jobs:
      #     format:
      #       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
      #       ...
      #
      #     lint:
      #       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
      #       ...
      #   ```
      #
      # Does not separate the commands
      # because without separating the commands by step or job,
      # you can check the all command results of `lint` task of Lefthok.
      # To check the all command results of a run task,
      # you look at Lefthook outputs.
      #
      # Example of Lefthook output
      # ``` console
      # $ lefthook run lint

      # Does not use `lint-fix` task of Lefthook.
      #
      # If you would like to fix codes,
      # you run `lefthook run lint-fix` command on your local
      # and then you commit to fix codes.
      #
      # You can commit to fix codes with using `lint-fix` task on this workflow,
      # but this workflow does not commit because the following three points.
      #
      # The premise is,
      # which if you use `lint-fix` task,
      # you would add a GitHub Action step to add a commit to this workflow.
      #
      # Example
      # ``` YAML
      # - name: run `lint-fix` task
      #   ...
      # - name: commit to fix codes
      #   ...
      # ```
      #
      # - Someone can add or overwrite codes easily
      #   Someone can it
      #   because if someone add command to add or overwrite codes
      #   to `lint-fix` task,
      #   GitHub Actions workflow would work the following:
      #
      #   1. Runs the commands of `lint-fix` task
      #   2. Runs a added command to add or overwrite codes
      #   3. Adds a commit to add or overwrite codes
      #
      # - The commit to be created has multiple types of fix
      #   If `lint-fix` task contains
      #   format (prettier) and lint (eslint) commands
      #   and than the both commands fix codes,
      #   which is commit type (style, refactor, docs) of Conventional Commits?
      #   Also what optional scope of Conventional Commits do you write?
      #
      #   hituzi no sippo (maintainer) prefers a commit message
      #   with one commit type and one optional scope.
      #   hituzi no sippo does not like a commit message with multiple those.
      #
      #   - Good: `docs(hoo): fix typos`
      #   - Hmm: `docs,style(hoo,bar): fix docs`
      #
      #   Conventional Commits
      #   https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
      #
      #   You can certainly create a commit with one kind of fix
      #   on GitHub Actions workflow,
      #   if you separate commands of `lint-fix` by GitHub Actions Step.
      #
      #   Example
      #   ``` YAML
      #   - name: Run prettier
      #     ...
      #   - name: commit to fix styles
      #     ...
      #   - name: Run eslint
      #     ...
      #   - name: commit to fix codes
      #     ...
      #   ````
      #
      #   hituzi no sippo does not prefer to separate commands
      #   by GitHub Actions step
      #   because if you separate commands of `lint-fix` by step,
      #   every time a tool is added,
      #   you have to add steps to run a command and add a commit.
      #   hituzi no sippo feels it tedious to add this GitHub Actions steps.
      #
      # - hituzi no sippo would like to modify a commit
      #   hituzi no sippo would like to modify a commit
      #   with using `git rebase --interactive --rebase` command.
      #   This is because
      #   hituzi no sippo prefers to modify a commit
      #   rather than add a commit to fix codes.
      #
      #   You should create a new commit to fix codes
      #   if modifying that commit,
      #   such as a commit of a remote main branch,
      #   would inconvenience other developers,
